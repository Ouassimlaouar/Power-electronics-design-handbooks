Power Electronics Design Handbooks

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of design handbooks for DC–DC and DC–AC converters, providing detailed guidance on analysis, modeling, control, and optimization. The handbooks bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical implementation, offering engineers, researchers, and students a structured resource for understanding the principles and methodologies behind modern power electronics systems.

Topics covered include:

DC–DC converter design: buck, boost, buck–boost, and more, with step-by-step calculations and performance analysis.

DC–AC conversion techniques: inverter topologies, modulation strategies, and control methods for efficient energy conversion.

The handbooks are designed to be practically oriented while maintaining scientific rigor, making them an essential reference for anyone involved in power electronics design, research, or education.
